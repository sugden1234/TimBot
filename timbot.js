Right after the Axe vs. Wizzy grand finals at Smash Summit 8, when Hbox presented Axe the 1st place award, Hbox begins a heartfelt speech to Axe by saying ‚Äúyou know, I won this award last summit..‚Äù and starts breaking up. Immediately, Twitch chat starts saying ‚Äúwow typical hungrybox making it all about himself.‚Äù Its absolutely amazing how everyone automatically assumes the worst and has never bothered to give the benefit of the doubt. If you go back and read /u/iamhungrybox comment on the Mango ama from 5 years ago, it‚Äôs really very awful how he‚Äôs been vilified in the community. Reminds me of Ken when he decided he wanted to retire. Everyone was rooting against him because he was the best, and he couldn‚Äôt handle the pressure. It‚Äôd be a fucking shame to see a talent like Hbox do the same. \nHbox if you see this, you‚Äôre fuckin sick at melee. Play the game for as long as you want to, but never feel pressured to keep going if its unhealthy.

It's weird that people on facebook still message me saying, "Dude you're actually a really nice person, everyone told me you were an asshole or something lawl". \nNow you've got the community in an even greater hold with your cult-esque fervor we call Mango Nation. You're the only person who can literally ride his own dick and people encourage you even more when you do it. If I was to even say a tenth of the self-promoting claims you make online, I'd have a brigade of hate lined up on top of the massive amount I already do. \nI don't have to go into how you treated me when I housed you and picked you up from the airport and the degrading and disgusting stuff you did and said about my mom. You think I don't remember? Not to mention saying similar things about my now ex-girlfriend. I really wanted to sock you in the fucking face so many times. \nBut I wouldn't stoop to that level. \nThe reality is, and the worst part is, that I have too much respect for you as a player. You've taken my favorite game and past-time to new levels and you constantly awe me with your advancing of the Melee meta-game. It keeps me on my feet and encourages me and countless others to keep playing. Everyone knows that, and no one can take that away from you.`,

I took the approach of the bigger man, in hopes that maybe it would inspire you to do the same. And I was very wrong. \nThe thing is, now that the entire fighting game community knows of you, you have all the leverage you need to get your points across. You're the end-all for knowledge of the game and community. \nYou've gotten better about your attitude towards me, at least subtly. With Armada retired and with our tournament records in full display, I'm ranked #2 or #3 in the world behind you. Even still, you make it seem like I'm a joke for ever playing this game. \nAll I'd like is for you to just stop this nonsense and have at least an ounce of sportsmanship towards me. It's the least you could do after some of the things you've put me through that I won't mention. And don't just label off your actions as jokes. Yeah, you're a funny guy.

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. \nHe said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù \nI was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. \nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. \nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.`,

"Hey, do y'all mind if I cut to the front of the line? I'm kind of in a hurry." Of course everyone agrees and he walks up to the counter. He orders 20 fucking chicken sandwiches. 20. I was still in shock from seeing him, but I try and strike up a conversation while he waits for his food. \"S- so, how do you feel about Chick-Fil-A and the gay rights controversy.\" He turns to me and says \"motherfucker, I come here BECAUSE I hate the gays!\" I'm stunned as the cashier brings Hbox his food. He picks up the tray, slams it on the ground, yells \"CLEAN IT UP\" at the cashier and walked out.`,

                `Every single tournament Hbox wins, I always immediately check these threads to read every angry post. It's like crack to me. I can not get enough of this. \nIt's like you people don't realise just how amazing HungryBox really is at this game. \nYou are so simple-minded that you can't fathom that ''muh tech skill'' isn't all that Melee has to offer. Hbox has a deeper understanding of the game than any other player. His spacing and mindgames are simply off the chart when it comes to pure depth. \nAll these people playing literally the most OP character in the game can't do shit against Hbox's smart play. He's literally picking all of them apart and doing so much mental damage that they start second doubting themselves and throwing games. That's some powerful play. \nI love watching Melee. Not only do I get to see my all-time favourite player destroy everyone, but I also get to see you faggots bitch and whine about what's essentially a mid tier. Keep crying though, but it won't change anything. \nGood games, Hbox! Will be rooting for you next time as well. Not that you'll need it. Wouldn't expect anything less from the #1 ranked Melee player!`,
                `And this weekend a miracle happened. I sat down to play Armada, I blinked, and my goal was suddenly behind me. A glass trophy in my hand with the official title written on it. Cameras flashing. Overwhelming emotion, disbelief, euphoria, and relief. Out of nowhere I played the best I have in my life while coming from losers. \nThe outpouring of congratulations I received was more than I ever would have imagined. It was a very beautiful experience to get to have that. And for that I'm very thankful. \nHowever, as expected there were some communities that don't see eye to eye on things. Like this subreddit, half of CFL Melee (my home community), and many others. And that's alright. That's reality. \nI'll never really understand why certain people don't realize what I put into this game. It might be the character I play. It might be my polarizing personality. But what I've learned is that you really can't focus on these things if you want to win. When I was on that stage I fell in love with Melee all over again. Just like I did when I attended my first very tournament in Florida and got 2nd to last place out of 40. \nI've had very difficult times reading things on this subreddit about me, but after this weekend I'm ready to move on from it. I proved to the world what I wanted to prove. I know I won't be able to change minds now or ever of that many people. But I respect your opinions and I encourage you to have them. I simply think it would be healthier for me to distance myself from it to continue performing at the level I want to. \nKeep playing Melee, keep cheering on your favorite player. Just love this game always. It's the best thing that's happened to me in a lot of ways, and I hope it's the same for you. \n-hungrybox`,
                `Every time Hbox pulls through, and he does every time, I always make sure to check these threads immediately. You virgins are the source of some premium salt. \n \nKeep in mind that Hbox is playing Jigglypuff, essentially a mid tier character, in a meta where 50% of all top 100 players are maining Fox, which is Puff's absolutely worst MU sitting at 70-30 in Fox's favour. You're all just fucking scrubs who can't accept that HungryBox is the single best player to ever have touched a GC controller. This is undeniable facts at this point. \n \nNo one else has managed to prove again and again that my skill reigns supreme. Year after year of consistent wins over every single opponent. Taking tourney after tourney. \n \nStay mad, bitches. He'll keep winning.`,
                `Hello /r/ssbm, \n \n I've read many, many, many things on this subreddit. A lot of them make me wonder about the backgrounds you all have had in competitive melee. My assumption is that most of you have at least attended/participated in one tournament and that you know a good bit about the history of the game. \n \nIf you have competed in the game, you're aware of what it's like to be in a hot seat. To have to think on the spot, adapt on the fly, cope with horrible losses, deal with salt, etc. \n \nMost of you (I think) understand what Melee is at its core. A phenomenal, unfathomably deep fighting game unlike any that's been created. It's why we love it and analyze it and have it as our passion. \n \nI've been competing for 10 years now. A lot of things have changed in this community. We almost didn't exist at one point when Brawl came out. We all had to pull a lot of weight to make sure we weren't forgotten and it's beautiful to see where we've gotten today. \n \nOnce Melee became a thriving, living community again it was a good time for me to focus on my own gameplay and not just the growth of the community. From 2013 to 2016 was probably my biggest era of growth both as a person maturing and as a Melee player. I obtained some much-needed discipline and learned more about myself from every event I attended. \n \nI yearned for the World Title. A massive goal for myself. And goals are something everyone here has - whether it's in Melee or outside of it. So I did everything I could to obtain that goal as soon as possible. I prioritized Melee for a summer, I got my best friend to be a sponsored coach for me, I became active in the Netplay community; Hell, I even took any chance to spread memes or information on social media about Smash. Because I love the community and I love what its given me.`,
                `You know what, I admit it: I don't like HBox. At a fundamental level, I know it's not rational, but let me tell you what I do know: I don't like it when his slow, broken character dunks on my favorite players and kills my excitement. I don't like it when he grandstands during interviews and looks so fake and disingenuous. I don't like it when I have to watch everything I find awesome about this game get back-aired off stage or up-tilt rested time an time again until I don't feel anything anymore`,

This leads to so many important questions, like: were the Cars Little Boy and Fat Man nukes sentient? Was it a suicide mission? Are ALL Cars nuclear weapons sentient? Did Tsar Bomba have a personality? What kind of car was Car Hitler? A VW? A forklift? Was there a Cars 9/11? Where the planes hijacked, or were the planes themselves radicalized? I could go on`,
